<h1>Osiris Browser</h1>

Osiris is an open-source browser based on the Chromium browser. Chromium was started by Google, to provide the source code for the proprietary Google Chrome browser. The two browsers share the majority of code and features. It aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all internet users to experience the web.

<h2>Web Search</h2>
Osiris is capable of rendering traditional websites, but its power is on its ability to navigate and display decentralized websites and applications. It was designed to adopt with other decentralized platforms thus making it powerful and united with all decentralized applications. Other platforms can build extensions on top of Cronus to make sure that their decentralized platforms protocol such as IPFS, Storj, SWARM, Shift and all incoming players can work together to achieve a fully neutral internet. We believe that there is no competition in achieving a new rich internet economy for all.

<h2>Decentralized Files Navigation</h2>
The browser is capable of viewing files from the Decenternet network similar to File Explorer behaviour. Having a File Explorer behaviour will definitely make Cronus browser powerful as it will not only solves the problems attached with file accessibility in desktop but in mobile devices as well. It will also support all file storage protocols by providing them an interface where they can build n browser extension to make it work flawlessly with our browser.

<h2>Wallet</h2>
A default wallet extension will be present in Cronus. The wallet is capable of sending and receiving tokens, token shapeshifting, buy and sell stuff on the decenternet. Initially it will support all top 10 tokens based on market cap for transactions.
Prerequisites:
It needs Spyce token
It needs a ledger to record transactions like bitcoin’s blockchain
They can purchase anything available using Spyce, if they have different token they should be able to convert it to Spyce without a hitch.

<h2>DApps Web Store</h2>
Is a store for decentralized apps. It could be any free and purchasable software such as games, utilities, office, and add-ons which consumes decentralized resources. With decenternet wallet connected, buying softwares using tokens will now become possible. DApps Store will create a sustainable economy for decentralized apps developer in Decenternet. Apps built in decenternet has an address which will help prevent piracy of softwares. Every transaction in DApps is recorded in a public ledger, and ownership of a app license is added in the blockchain.

<h2>Plugins</h2>
The browser will support traditional plugins and decentralized add-ons.
